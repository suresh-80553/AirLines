An airline reservation system using HTML is a web-based platform that allows users to search for flights, view available options, and make flight reservations with an airline. Built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the system provides a user-friendly interface where travelers can input their travel details, such as departure and destination cities, dates, and passenger information. The system then processes the user's request and presents a list of available flights, along with relevant details like flight numbers, departure times, and ticket prices. Users can select their preferred flights and proceed to book tickets, providing payment and contact information. This HTML-based reservation system simplifies the flight booking process, enabling travelers to conveniently plan and secure their flights online.
